My name is Kevin DeLoach and I'm a software engineer with a background in full
stack web application development.

I have extensive working knowledge and experience programming with Go, Python,
Django, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

My area of expertise is backend server-side programming, API design,
automation, and building web applications end-to-end.


Previously, I worked for IBM Tealeaf, Azavea, TellusLabs, Warner Bros. Digital

I'm currently self-employed.
