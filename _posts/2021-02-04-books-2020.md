title: Books Read in 2020
---

I read 27 books in 2020. Mostly science fiction, followed by software
development, and productivity.

*Raising Lions* had the biggest impact on my life this year. This book teaches
how to effectively discipline toddlers to prevent behavior disorders. It really
works.

*The Nature of Order* was the most challenging. This book describes 15
properties present in nature and living structures: Levels of Scale, Strong
Centers, Boundaries, Alternating Repetition, Positive Space, Good Shape, Local
Symmetries, Deep Interlock and Ambiguity, Contrast, Gradients, Roughness,
Echoes, The Void, Simplicity and Inner Calm, and Not-separateness.

*There Is No Antimemetics Division* was the most unique. The story is about an
agency which combats interdimensional beings while their memory is constantly
being erased.
