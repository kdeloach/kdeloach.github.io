title: Books Read in 2020

I read 27 books in 2020. Mostly science fiction, followed by software development, and productivity.
*Raising Lions* had the biggest impact on my life this year, by giving me a new perspective on parenting,
along with useful strategiest for raising my daughter.
*The Nature of Order* was the most challenging, taking nearly 2 years of casual reading to complete.
*There Is No Antimemetics Division* surprised me the most, with its unique storytelling device.
