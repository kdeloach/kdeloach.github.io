I've been using the [Workman keyboard layout][workman] for about 4 weeks
now, and other than [Ubuntu randomly changing keyboard layouts][ubuntu-bug],
it's been a positive experience.

As my touch typing speed increased, I was surprised to find that my fingers
would occasionally revert to Dvorak, which I have not typed for years.
Although I think that Dvorak is a great layout, I don't find it particularly
attuned to programming and general keyboard shortcuts compared to the Workman
layout. Try to copy & paste on a Dvorak keyboard and you'll see what I mean.

I enjoy using the Workman layout and I plan to keep using it indefinitely.

My typing speed is presently around 40-50 WPM.
