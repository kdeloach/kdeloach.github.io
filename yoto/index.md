[Yoto][1] icon picker with free text search built using [OpenAI GPT-4
Vision][2] for image classification.

The purpose of this tool is to help find images from the default icon set for
custom Yoto card playlists. The official Yoto icon picker is uncategorized and
randomly ordered which makes it very difficult to use.

<!--Some descriptions generated by GPT-4 are technically accurate, yet useless. For
example, "black yellow insect-like" instead of "bee" or "four-legged animal"
instead of "dog." I plan on improving these descriptions manually over time,
depending on how often I use this tool.-->

GPT-4 Vision was able to classify all but a handful of images from this icon
set. The mouse and "blue tidal wave" were unable to be processed because they
were deemed to be "unsafe" content. The numbers 7, 20, 21, "metal spoon", and
"light bulb with face" were unable to be processed for unknown reasons.

Prompt:

> Describe this image as a list of words separated by comma. Be as detailed and
specific as possible. Focus on the object of the image as a whole. Exclude
words describing the background or art style (ex. 'pixelated', 'pixel',
'8-bit', 'abstract', 'minimal', 'simplistic', 'avatar'). Include words
describing sentiment, emotion, color, and tone. Prefer formatting like '5'
instead of 'five'. Don't repeat words. Limit response to 20 words.
