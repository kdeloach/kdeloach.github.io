Streamline weight lifting workouts by calculating the ideal order to load
plates on the bar between each set. This helps to avoid adding and removing
plates from the bar uneccesarily.

For example, if your workout has 3 sets: `100`, `120`, `100` the naive solution
would be to load `25, 2.5` for the first set, `25, 10, 2.5` for the second set,
and then `25, 2.5` for the final set. This involves removing and re-adding the
`2.5` plate in both sets 2 and 3. The ideal solution, generated by this
calculator, would be to load `25, 2.5` for the first set, `25, 2.5, 10` for the
second set, and `25, 2.5` for the final set. This is just a simple example, but
the calculator becomes considerably more useful for longer sets when heavier
weights are involved.
