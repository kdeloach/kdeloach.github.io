  <h1>Books 2020</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I read 27 books in 2020. Mostly science fiction, followed by software
development, and productivity. Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of the top 3 books I
read this year as well as the full list.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p><strong>Raising Lions</strong> was the most useful book this year. It describes methods to
effectively discipline children with compassion to prevent behavioral
disorders. After reading this book, I began to use frequent yet short 1-2
minute timeouts immediately after bad behavior occurred. This turned out to be
highly effective. I recommend this book for new parents.</p>

<p><strong>The Nature of Order</strong> was the most challenging. The premise of this book is
that beauty is objective and comes from properties which are present in nature
and living structures. The book describes 15 geometric properties discovered
through empirical research in great visual detail.</p>

<p><strong>There Is No Antimemetics Division</strong> was the most unique. The story is about an
organization which must defend the world against highly unusual
interdimensional creatures. The creature in this story has the unique ability
to erase itself from the memory of anyone who becomes aware of its existence.
